Self-Assessment: Understanding Onion Architecture, MVC, and Web API in .NET Core and Encountered Bottlenecks
Conceptual Understanding:

Onion Architecture:

Awareness: Yes, I have heard of the Onion Architecture principle in software design.
MVC Pattern:

Familiarity: Yes, I am familiar with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for building web applications.
Web API:

Knowledge: No, I do not understand the concept of building RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API.
Application & Bottlenecks:

Onion Architecture:

Benefits:
Organizes code into distinct layers, enhancing clarity and maintainability.
Facilitates easier modifications without widespread impact.
Improves testability.
Challenges Encountered: Yes, I have encountered difficulties with understanding and implementing Onion Architecture, often leading to errors and confusion due to its complexity.
MVC Pattern:

Components:
Model: Manages data and business logic, handling data processing and rules.
View: Displays data to the user, representing the user interface.
Controller: Bridges the Model and View, handling user input and updating the Model.
Challenges Encountered: Yes, I have found the tight coupling between Model and Controller to be sometimes complicated, although I grasp the basic concepts.
Web API:

Differences from MVC:
Traditional MVC: Builds full web applications with Models managing data and logic, Views rendering HTML, and Controllers handling input and interactions, aimed at generating dynamic web pages.
Web API: Focuses on providing data services, using Models and Controllers without Views, returning data in formats like JSON or XML for consumption by other applications or services.
Challenges Encountered: Yes, traditional MVC applications can be more complex than Web APIs, requiring many changes to fix errors, leading to performance overhead from frequent page refreshes and complex data exchanges.
